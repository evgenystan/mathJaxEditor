=============

MathJax is a wonderful piece of software. It offers a convenient way to include beatifully typeset mathematics into a web page. 

Editor plug-in is designed to enable a client to edit mathematics on the page without any knowledge of LaTEX. In particular, the page author has absolute control over where the a client can edit mathematics and where he/she cannot.
The plug-in also offers a way to retrieve parts or the whole of mathematical expression that has been edited by a client. This particular feature is especially useful for online assessment systems, allowing students to enter their answers in a way they would write them on a piece of paper.

This plug-in is limited to free services only. No commercial use.
